# weather-application

*I have created this simple project as part of my first task under CodeClause Internship*

This is the code for my weather API apllication project.
I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to create a simple webpage that fetches forecast on demand.
The API key was obtained from openweathermaps.org

*I will not be putting the API key in this as it is sensitive*
