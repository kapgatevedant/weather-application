*I have created this simple project as part of my first task under CodeClause Internship*

This is the code for a weather apllication project.
I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript in order to create a simple webpage that fetches forecast on demand.
The API key was obtained from openweathermap.org

*I will not be putting the API key in this as it is sensitive*

*How to obtain API key*

1. Go to openweathermap.org
2. Create account if not already.
3. Go to API Keys tab in your profile.
4. Generate and Name a key (or use the existing one).
5. Copy the API key and go to Script.js file.
6. Paste it in getWeather() replacing 'API key here'.
